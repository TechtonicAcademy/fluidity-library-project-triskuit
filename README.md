# Fluidity Library Project Sprint #1

## Instructions:

- Clone this repository locally in an easy-to-access location.

- Create a new branch named 'develop'. Going forward each Jira ticket you work should use its own feature branch created off of the latest 'develop' branch code. After a ticket is completed, its code should be code reviewed and, once approved, merged into 'develop'. Name your feature branches according to the Jira ticket you are working.

- Initialize npm in your new local repository.

- Create your file structure. [See example structure here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NtcCcDG2fkXCbgA2YRrK77mt9W42mSo2Tq8AahwtUk/edit). Note that the example structure referenced here is likely more complex than what you will need, but it can be a valuable guide to how to divide your SCSS code up into reusable modules.

- Add, commit, and push your initial changes.

- Build out your HTML structure and BEM + SCSS styling, based on the [Library Project Wireframes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8iGpt6CXeVkP9Ii7sbFsvrQQXSX8mDv). 

- Remember to access your code locally via the Parcel server url; without it your SCSS wonâ€™t work!

- Note: No JavaScript functionality should be completed in Sprint #1; the focus should be on building out static HTML structure and reusable, best-practices styles using BEM + SCSS.

- **HINT:** Run `parcel *.html` through your command line to run your project locally. This will allow you to access each of your HTML files from the browser via http://localhost:1234/filenamehere.html.
